<h1>SimpleParse <font size="-2">A Parser Generator for mxTextTools v2.0.0</font></h1>
                                                       
<p>SimpleParse is a <a href="#License">BSD-licensed</a> Python package providing 
     a simple parser         generator for use with the <a
 href="http://www.lemburg.com/files/python/mxTextTools.html">mxTextTools</a> 
             text-tagging engine.  SimpleParse allows you to generate tagging 
    tables       for  use with the text-tagging engine directly from your 
EBNF    grammar.<br>
                   </p>
                                     
<p>Unlike    most parser generators, SimpleParse generates single-pass parsers 
         (there   is no distinct tokenization stage), an approach taken from 
   the    predecessor     project (mcf.pars) which attempted to create "autonomously 
       parsing regex    objects".  The resulting parsers are not as generalized 
      as those created by, for instance, the Earley algorithm, but they  
do   tend to be useful   for the parsing of computer file formats and the 
like    (as distinct  from natural  language and similar "hard" parsing problems).<br>
                           </p>
                                                     
<p>In addition to the parser generator, the <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/simpleparse/"> SimpleParse project</a> 
             includes a sub-project to create a   modified    version of the
     mxTextTools  engine which reorganizes the code to allow    for certain 
  common    EBNF constructs.<br>
                           </p>
                                                     
<p>For those interested in working on the project, I'm actively interested 
             in welcoming and supporting both new developers and new users.

<h2>Acquisition and Installation</h2>
                           
<p>              You will need a copy of Python with <a
 href="http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/download.html">distutils</a> 
             support (Python versions 2.0 and above include this).  If   you
want to build the non-recursive TextTools engine,  you'll      also  need
 a C compiler compatible with your Python build and understood    by   distutils.</p>
                                          
<p>To install the base SimpleParse engine, <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=55673">download 
             the latest version</a> in your preferred format.  If you are 
using      the    Win32   installer, simply run the executable.  If you are 
using   one   of the   source   distributions, unpack the distribution into 
a temporary      directory    (maintaining   the directory structure) then 
run:         </p>
                           
<pre>setup.py install</pre>
                           
<p>              in the top directory created by the expansion process.</p>
                           
<p>              </p>
                           
<p>              You will want the <a
 href="http://www.lemburg.com/files/python/mxExtensions.html#mxTextTools">mxBase 
             2.1.0</a> distribution to run SimpleParse.  This package should 
   be    available   in all the standard formats, follow the same instructions
      as  for the SimpleParse   package to install.  If you want to use the
  non-recursive   implementation, you will need to get the source archive.
  It is possible  to use mxBase 2.0.3 with SimpleParse, but not to use it
for building the non-recursive TextTools engine.  Note: without the non-recursive
  rewrite of 2.1.0, the test suite will not pass all tests.  A single test
(which is tested with a number of different versions of the simpleparse grammar)
will fail.  I'm not sure why it fails with the recursive version, but it
does argue for using the non-recursive rewrite.</p>
                           
<p>              </p>
                           
<p>To build the non-recursive TextTools engine,    you'll    need to get
the source distribution for the non-recursive implementation       from the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=55673">SimpleParse 
             file repository</a>.  This archive is intended to be expanded 
 over     the    mxBase source archive from the top-level directory (it was 
 created   with the 2.1.0 beta1 distribution      specifically),   replacing 
 one file   and adding four others.<br>
          </p>
                   
<pre>cd egenix-mx-base-2.1.0<br>gunzip non-recursive-1.0.0b1.tar.gz<br>tar -xvf non-recursive-1.0.0b1.tar<br></pre>
                   
<p>(Or use WinZip on Windows). When you  have    completed that,   run:</p>
                                   
<pre>setup.py build --force install<br></pre>
                           
<p>   in the top directory of the eGenix-mx-base source tree.  It is hoped
     that eventually the non-recursive rewrite will be folded into the eGenix-mx-base
     distribution so this extra step won't be necessary.      </p>
                           
<h2>Features</h2>
                         
<p>      New in 2.0:</p>
                                     
<ul>
                     <li>New, refactored and simplified API.  Most of the 
time   you   only    need    to deal with a single class for all your interactions
   with   the parser system (<a href="pydoc/simpleparse.parser.html">simpleparse.parser</a>.Parser),
 and one module if you decide to use the provided                   post-processing
 mechanism (<a href="pydoc/simpleparse.dispatchprocessor.html">simpleparse.dispatchprocessor</a>).</li>
                     <li>"Expanded Productions" -- allow you to define productions
     whose    children  are reported as if the enclosing production did not
  exist   (allows    you to use productions for organisational as well as
reporting     purposes)</li>
                     <li>Exposure of <a
 href="processing_result_trees.html#nonstandardresulttrees">callout mechanism</a>
in mxTextTools</li>
        <li>Exposure of "LookAhead" mechanism in mxTextTools (allows you
to  spell  "is followed by", "is not followed by", or "matches x but doesn't 
match y"  in SimpleParse EBNF grammars).  Specified with the prefix ?, as 
in ?-"this" which matches iff "this" is not the next item, but on matching 
doesn't move the read-head forward (more precisely, it causes the engine to
continue processing at the previous position).</li>
      <li>"Error on fail" error-reporting facility, allows you to raise Parser
  Syntax Errors when particular productions (or element tokens) fail to match.
   Allow for fairly flexible error  reporting.  To specify, just add a '!'
 character after the element token that must match, or include it as a stand-alone
 token in a sequential group to specify that all subsequent items must succeed. 
 You can specify an error message format by using a string literal after the
! character.</li>
   <li>Library of common constructs (<a
 href="pydoc/simpleparse.common.html">simpleparse.common</a> package) which 
are easily included in your grammars<br>
   </li>
       <li>Hexidecimal escapes for string and character ranges</li>
    <li>Rewritten generators -- the generator interface has  been   seperated
      from the parser interfaces, this makes it possible to write   grammars
 directly     using generator objects if desired, and allows defining   the
 EBNF grammar    using the same tools as generate derived parsers</li>
    <li>An XML-Parser (including DTD parsing) based  on the XML specification's 
EBNF (this is not a production parser, merely  an example for parsing a complex 
file format, and is not yet Unicode capable)</li>
    <li>Example VRML97 and LISP parsers<br>
    </li>
                     <li>Compatability API for SimpleParse 1.0 applications<br>
                     </li>
    <li>With the non-recursive mxTextTools, can process (albeit    inefficiently)
      recursion-as-repetition grammars               </li>
                                             <li>Non-recursive rewrite of 
mxTextTools   now ~95% of the speed of                 the recursive version 
              </li>
                                     
</ul>
                         
<p>      General</p>
                                                     
<ul>
                            <li>Simple-to-use interface, define an EBNF and 
 start    parsing</li>
                     <li>Fast for small files -- this is primarily a feature
  of  the   underlying  TextTools engine, rather than a particular feature
 of the  parser   generator.</li>
                     <li>Allows pre-built and external parsing functions, 
which    allows    you   to define Python methods to handle tricky parsing 
tasks</li>
                                     
</ul>
 
<h3>"Class" of Parsers Generated</h3>
 
<p>Our (current) parsers are top-down, in that they work from the top of
the parsing graph (the root production). They are not, however, tokenising
parsers, so there is no appropriate LL(x) designation as far as I can see,
and there is an arbitrary lookahead mechanism that could theoretically parse
the entire rest of the file just to see if a particular character matches).
 I would hazard a guess that they are theoretically closest to a deterministic
recursive-descent parser.<br>
 </p>
 
<p>There are no backtracking facilities, so any ambiguity is handled by choosing 
the first successful match of a grammar (not the longest, as in most top-down 
parsers, mostly because without tokenisation, it would be expensive to do 
checks for each possible match's length).  As a result of this, the parsers 
are entirely deterministic.<br>
 </p>
 
<p>The time/memory characteristics are such that, in general, the time to 
parse an input text varies with the amount of text to parse. There are two 
major factors, the time to do the actual parsing (which, for simple deterministic 
grammars should be close to linear with the length of the text, though a pathalogical
grammar might have radically different operating characteristics) and the
time to build the results tree (which depends on the memory architecture of
the machine, the currently free memory, and the phase of the moon).  As a
rule, SimpleParse parsers will be faster (for suitably limited grammars) than
anything you can code directly in Python.  They will not generally outperform 
grammar-specific parsers written in C.<br>
 </p>
                                     
<h2>Missing Features<br>
                   </h2>
                                     
<ul>
                     <li>SimpleParse does not current use an Earley or similar
   highly    generalised    parser, instead, it uses a simple deterministic
  parsing algorithm   which,   though fast for certain classes of problems,
  is incapable of dealing   with   ambiguity, backtracking or cross-references</li>
   <li>The library of common patterns is extremely sparse</li>
                     <li>No case-insensitive matching commands available
              </li>
                     <li>Unicode support</li>
   <li>There is no analysis or (significant) reduction done on the grammar. 
 Having now read most of <a
 href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/%7Edick/PTAPG.html">Parsing Techniques - A Practical 
Guide</a>, I can see how some fairly significant changes will be required 
to support such operations (and thereby the more common parsing techniques).<br>
  </li>
 
</ul>
                                     
<h2>Possible Future Directions</h2>
                                                       
<ul>
                              <li>Alternative parsing back-ends -- the new
 objectgenerator         module is fairly well isolated from the rest of
the  system, and encompasses         most of the dependencies on the mxTextTools
 engine.  Adding an optional       Earley  or similar back-end should be
possible  with minimal upset to  the    project.  A backend using re objects
is another  possibility (my precursor      mcf.pars engine was written to
use regexen  for parsing, and was an acceptable      (though not stellar)
performer).</li>
                     <li>Alternative EBNF grammars -- SimpleParse's EBNF, 
though    fairly readily understood,   is not by any means the only EBNF variant,
providing    support   for a number   of EBNF variants would ease the job
of porting  grammars  to   the system.</li>
                     <li>More common/library code -- common data formats, 
HTML   and/or SGML parsers</li>
                                                                  
</ul>
                         
<p>      mxTextTools Rewrite Enhancements</p>
                                     
<ul>
                     <li>Case-insensitive matching commands?            
    </li>
                     <li>Backtracking support?</li>
                                                                      
</ul>
       
<p>Alternate C Back-end?<br>
    </p>
       
<ul>
      <li>Given the amount of effort poured into the mxTextTools engine,
this   may seem silly, but it would be nice to implement a more advanced
parsing   algorithm directly in C, without going through the assembly-like
interface   of mxTextTools.  Given that Marc-André isn't interested in adopting
the non-recursive  codebase, there's not much point retaining compatability
with mxTextTools,  so moving to a more parser-friendly engine might be the
best approach.<br>
      </li>
       
</ul>
